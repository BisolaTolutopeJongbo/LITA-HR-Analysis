### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that certain groups, specifically employees in Life Sciences, Sales, and females, experience higher attrition rates. Attrition is also influenced by job role, with roles like Sales Executive showing higher dissatisfaction levels. These insights suggest targeted interventions in high-attrition departments and roles, as well as an emphasis on addressing female employee retention. Furthermore, understanding age and marital status trends can assist HR in structuring retention policies and engagement strategies.
